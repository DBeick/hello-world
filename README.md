# hello-world
My first repository.

I am new to GitHub, and I hope that taking the time to become experienced
  herein will prove to be very beneficial, both for my career and my
  own enjoyment of coding.
  
I have just graduated from the University of Oregon with a degree in
  Mathematics and Computer Science. I am working as a QA Intern at
  CBT Nuggets in Eugene, Oregon. I have experience working with python,
  java, C and C++, and I have exposure to HTML, CSS, javascript, x86,
  and php. I hope to become a master of web coding and developing highly
  productive projects, both large and small.
